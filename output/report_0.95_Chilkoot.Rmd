# Background
The objectives of this analysis were to:  

  1.  Model the tails of the run to quantify a removal date for weir operations â€“ the date to which the weir would be required to be operated through (e.g., would capture 95% of the escapement with 95% probability; hard date). The earliest date a project can end (i.e., end date) is the day after the hard date. 
  
  2. Estimate the percent of counts missed if the project was operated following the X-day 1% rule (daily counts equal less than 1% of the cumulative count for X days (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days) in a row up to and including the hard end date). For example, if the hard date is Julian day 247 and days 243 to 247 are <1% of the cumulative counts for 5 days, then the end date for that year would be Julian day 248.   

All associated files, data, and code are located at https://github.com/commfish/weiRends. This work is based upon efforts originally developed by Scott Raborn. The code was originally written by Ben Williams and then adapted by Sara Miller. 


## Definitions
*hard date*: The escapement date that captures 95% of the escapement with 95% probability. The date to which the weir would be required to be operated through. 

*end date*: The day after the escapement date that captures 95% of the escapement with 95% probability. The date the project can be ended, based on the 1% rule (median date). The earliest date a project can end is the day after the hard date. 

# Data Inputs

The input data format is four columns with date (preferably in year-mm-dd format), weir count data, species, and year. 

An example is:  
  date      count   species  year  
2019-07-20    20    Sockeye  2019

This is for a single species at a single weir. 
No other values or comments should be included in the file. 
Data should be provided in .csv format. 

# Analysis
Two models were considered: 

The Gompertz model 
$$p\mathrm{e}^{{-e}^{-k(t-t_0)}},$$ 
and the logistic model 
$$\frac{p}{\mathrm{1+e}^{-k(t-t_0)}}.$$ 
The variable *p* represents the asymptote of the cumulative escapement, *k* is the steepness of the curve, and *t*~0~ is the inflection point of the curve. 

The evaluation process starts by fitting both models, and then the model with the least total variance is chosen for the analysis. 
*Note that this is a coarse approach and is not a meaningful model comparison*.
Cumulative run is predicted from the selected model and then this is converted into the number of estimated fish past the weir for a given day.
A reconstructed run is estimated using observed daily data, filling in any data gaps with estimated daily escapement numbers. 
This reconstructed run is then used to compute a cumulative sum of escapement. 
The date that a weir should remain in place to capture the 95th percentile of 95% of the escapement, based on the 10 most recent years (2012-2021; hard date), is calculated using the reconstructed cumulative sum. Based on the model deviance, the logistic model provided an overall better fit to the data than the Gompertz model. None of the parameter estimates had substantial error bars (Figure \@ref(fig:param-koot)) and the models converged for all years.

## 1% Rule (*Hard Date* and *End Date*)
Using only the 10 most recent years of data, the 95th percentile date when 95% of the run has passed the weir  is Julian day `r tbls_koot$run_through$end_date` (the hard ending date), and the end date is Julian day 248 (Julian day `r tbls_koot$run_through$end_date` plus one day). Based upon these dates, there is a 95% chance of capturing 95-97% of the total run for all weir removal rules (number of days; Table \@ref(tab:chance-koot)). In addition, there is a 50% chance of capturing 99% of the run. This is also reflected in the percent risk as well (Figure \@ref(fig:risk-koot)); Figure \@ref(fig:risk-koot) reflects the inverse of Table \@ref(tab:chance-koot). For example, a 99% chance is the same as a 1% risk. About 3%  of the run is missed (i.e., 97% caught) at a given risk level (99% chance or 1% risk level) based on implementing a 5-day 1% rule.

# Conclusions
  1. The hard ending date, based on the 1% 5-day rule is Julian date `r tbls_koot$run_through$end_date`. 
  
  3. Based upon the median weir removal date (end date; Julian date 248), using the number of days to implement the 1% rule for the Chilkoot River, there is a 95% chance of capturing 97% of the total run for the 5-day rule.
