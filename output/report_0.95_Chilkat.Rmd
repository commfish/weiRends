# Background
The objectives of this analysis were to:  

  1.  Model the tails of the escapement to quantify the date to which the weir would be required to be operated through (e.g., would capture 95% of the escapement with 95% probability; the hard date). The earliest date a project can end is the day after the hard date. 
  
  2. Estimate the percent of counts missed if the project was operated following the $x$-day 1% rule (daily counts equal less than 1% of the cumulative count for $x$ days (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days) in a row up to and including the hard date). For example, if the hard date is Julian day 247 and days 243 to 247 are <1% of the cumulative counts for 5 days, then the end date for that year would be Julian day 248.   

All associated files, data, and code are located at https://github.com/commfish/weiRends. This work is based upon efforts originally developed by Scott Raborn. The code was originally written by Ben Williams and then adapted by Sara Miller. 


## Definitions
*hard date*: The escapement date that captures 95% of the escapement with 95% probability. The date to which the weir would be required to be operated through. 

*end date*: The end date is the estimated day the weir project would have ended in the past if the 1% rule had been in place. The end date is expressed as the median date and as a range (end range) of dates (e.g., 25th–75th percentiles or minimum–maximum). The projected end date and end range can be used for planning purposes.  

# Data Inputs

The input data format is four columns with date (preferably in year-mm-dd format), weir count data, species, and year. 

An example is:  
  date      count   species  year  
2019-07-20    20    Sockeye  2019

This is for a single species at a single weir. 
No other values or comments should be included in the file. 
Data should be provided in .csv format. 

# Analysis
Two models were considered: 

The Gompertz model 
$$p\mathrm{e}^{{-e}^{-k(t-t_0)}},$$ 
and the logistic model 
$$\frac{p}{\mathrm{1+e}^{-k(t-t_0)}}.$$ 
The variable *p* represents the asymptote of the cumulative escapement, *k* is the steepness of the curve, and *t*~0~ is the inflection point of the curve. 

The evaluation process starts by fitting both models, and then the model with the least total variance is chosen for the analysis. 
*Note that this is a coarse approach and is not a meaningful model comparison*.
Cumulative escapement is predicted from the selected model and then this is converted into the number of estimated fish past the weir for a given day.
A reconstructed escapement is estimated using observed daily data, filling in any data gaps with estimated daily escapement numbers. 
This reconstructed escapement is then used to compute a cumulative sum of escapement. 
The date that a weir should remain in place to capture the 95th percentile of 95% of the escapement is calculated using the reconstructed cumulative sums. Based on the model deviance, the Gompertz model provided an overall better fit to the data than the logistic model. The models converged for all years, and year 2014 was the only year that had large error bars (Figure \@ref(fig:param-koot)) for parameters $p$ and $t$.

## 1% Rule (*Hard Date* and *End Date*)
Using the last ten years of the time series (2012-2021), the 95th percentile date when 95% of the escapement has passed the weir  is Julian day `r tbls_chilkat$run_through$end_date` or `r tbls_chilkat$run_through$date` (the hard date). The earliest date the project can end is is Julian day 319 or 15 November (Julian day `r tbls_chilkat$run_through$end_date` plus one day; end date). Based upon these dates, there is a 95% chance of capturing roughly 95% of the total escapement for all weir removal rules (number of days; Table \@ref(tab:chance-koot)). In addition, there is a 50% chance of capturing about 97% of the escapement. This is also reflected in the percent risk as well (Figure \@ref(fig:risk-koot)); Figure \@ref(fig:risk-koot) reflects the inverse of Table \@ref(tab:chance-koot). For example, a 99% chance is the same as a 1% risk. About 5%  of the escapement is missed (i.e., 95% caught) at a given risk level (99% chance or 1% risk level) based on implementing a 5-day 1% rule. 

The projected median date that the project would end is Julian day 319 (15 November) for all weir removal rules (Table \@ref(tab:remove-koot)). The project end date was based on the last ten years of the time series (2012-2021) and estimates of when the weir would have been removed had the 1% rule been used to manage weir operations. The maximum date of weir removal is Julian day 319 (15 November) using the 5-day, 4- day, and 3-day 1% rule (Table \@ref(tab:remove-koot)). 

If the entire time series (1971-2021) is used for the analysis, results varied slightly; the end date is extended by 3 days (see Appendix Table \@ref(tab:chance-koot-all); Table \@ref(tab:remove-koot-all); Figure \@ref(fig:all-year-plot)). Based on the model deviance, the Gompertz model provided an overall better fit to the data than the logistic model. The models converged for all years, but year 2003 had substantial error bars (Figure \@ref(fig:param-koot-all)) for parameters $p$ and $t$. If the entire time series is used, the year 2003 needs to be investigated further and may need to be removed as an outlier. Using the entire time series, the 95th percentile date when 95% of the escapement has passed the weir  is Julian day `r tbls_chilkat_all_data$run_through$end_date` or `r tbls_chilkat_all_data$run_through$date` (the hard date). The earliest date the project can end is is Julian day 322 or 18 November (Julian day `r tbls_chilkat_all_data$run_through$end_date` plus one day; end date).

# Conclusions
  1. The hard date, the date to which the weir must be operated through, is Julian day `r tbls_chilkat$run_through$end_date` or `r tbls_chilkat$run_through$date`. 
  
  3. Based upon the median weir removal date (end date; Julian day 319 or 15 November), using the number of days to implement the 1% rule for the Chilkat Lake, there is a 95% chance of capturing about 95% of the total escapement for the 5-day rule.
