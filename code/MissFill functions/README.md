## JTPfunctions
November 1, 2021
These functions were written by Justin Priest (ADF&G). Originally the MissFill function was a macro that Jim Blick created way back when. Leon Shaul always cited Brown, M. B. 1974. Identification of sources of significance in two-way contingency tables. Applied Statistics 23:405–413 (attached), and Jim Blick provided him some suggested text to include in reports (see references). In 2003, we (Heinl et al.) started citing McLachlan and Krishnan (1997), The EM Algorithm and Extensions, John Wiley and Sons, New York, for the method of interpolating missing values. Steve Heinl doesn’t own this book, and he is pretty certain the citation was provided at the time by Hal Geiger.  For the pink salmon index “If a particular index stream is missing escapement counts for any given year, an iterative EM algorithm (McLachlan and Krishnan 1997) is used to interpolate a peak count. Missing counts are interpolated by assuming that the expected count for a given year is equal to the sum of all counts for that stream, divided by the sum of all counts over all years for all the streams in the unit (i.e., row total times column total divided by grand total). This assumes a multiplicative relation between yearly count and unit count, with no interaction (Zadina et al. 2003, page 12 in the attached)."

These functions may be used instead of the Gompertz or logistic to model the escapement tails for a certin time period when counts are missing.
